## NUSMiniMods ðŸ“•

Are you an NUS (National University of Singapore) student who may be struggling to get your module planning sorted but confused by the sometimes disorienting chain of prerequisites? Or not sure what modules to take next semester? Or just being too busy due to hall activities or lazy to search for them on [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com/)? Fret not, **NUSMiniMods**, the miniature, light-weight version of a module planner now comes in handy!

### What's this?

NUSMiniMods is a Telegram bot that has two main functions: providing a list of prerequisite modules for the modules that you plan to take next semester and recommending a list of modules based on the modules you have taken this semester.

### Notable features

- MC (Modular Credit) calculator as users input their desired list of modules
- Overloading/underloading advice
- Links to NUSMods module page included
- Modules not offered filtered out from search results

### Some technical information

This Telegram bot is built entirely with Python, referencing tutorials provided by the hackathon organiser (such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdH48PQddZ0)), as well as various other online resources.

The NUS module data is fetched from the [API](https://api.nusmods.com/v2/) provided by NUSMods.

Some third-party dependencies used in this project:-
- [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) (13.14+)
- [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (2.28.1+)
